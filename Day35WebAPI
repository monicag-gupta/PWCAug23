Step 1:
MemberAPI:

Create a new Project with 
Language: C#, 
Project Template Type: Web
Project Template : ASP.NET Core Web API
Click Next 
Configure a new Project with 
Project Name : MemberAPI, 
Project Location : Default
Click Next
Give defaults in Additional Information
Click Create

New Web API gets created

It gets the default API as the Weather Forecast API.

Start the Project in IIS Express (Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge or Chrome or any of your favorite browser).

Install the Certificate for SSL 




Step 2:

Member.Data class library:

Create a new Project with 
Language: C#, 
Project Template Type: All Project types
Project Template : Class Library
Click Next 
Configure a new Project with 
Project Name : Member.Data, 
Project Location : Default
Click Next
Select .Net 5.0 as Version
Click Create
New Class Library gets created

Now Add three Folders: Model, Interface, and Repository in Member.Data Class library.

In the model folder, create a Model Class called Members.

In the interface, Create Member Interface called IMember.

In the repository folder, Create Class Called “MembersRepository” and implement IMembers interface in it. 

In the real world, this class will interact with DB but in this demo, I will use hardcoded members data.
