ADO.NET Data Access :
1. Set up a Data Connection
– Establishes a link to the data source
2. Set up a DataAdapter
– Handles retrieving and updating the data
– Data adapter uses “Command” objects to retrieve/store records from/to the database and can be used to:
3. Create a DataSet:
A temporary set of data tables stored in the computer’s memory
ADO.NET datasets are disconnected
– So data in memory does not keep an active connection to data source
– Much better: Many more clients can connect and use the data server
DataAdapters’s Fill(-,-) method gets a data table into the DataSet
– Uses SQL in a “Command” object to specify data to retrieve/update
4.. Add controls on the Windows Form or Web Form
– Display the data from the DataSet and allow user interaction
5. Write C# code to put the data into the controls
