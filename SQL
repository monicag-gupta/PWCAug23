RDBMS:
Each table in a database has a unique table name.
The row (or record) in the table is called a tuple.
The column (or field) is called an attribute. 
Every column in a table must have a unique name. 
The number of tuples is called the cardinality of the table.
The number of attributes is called the degree of the table.
A column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table is called the primary key 
A table where every row is different from all other rows is called a relation.
A domain is a collection of values from which one or more attributes (columns) draw their actual values. 
In RDBMS, missing or unknown information is represented as a NULL value in a table. 
NULL is not the same as space or zero.


The various types of keys used in an RDBMS are:
Primary : Unique + Not Null
Foreign : Pkey in other Relation
Candidate: Many keys who can become PKey
Alternate : Can become PKey



Normalization results in the formation of tables that satisfy certain normal forms.
The normal forms are used to remove various types of abnormalities and inconsistencies from the database.
The most important and widely used normal forms are:
First Normal Form (1NF)
when each cell of the table contains precisely one value
RDBMS
Second Normal Form (2NF)
No partial dependency exists between non-key attributes and key attributes
Pkey or AltKey
Third Normal Form (3NF)
No transitive (indirect) dependency exists between non-key attributes and key attributes
CompositeKey : work for all records
Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
if and only if every determinant is a candidate key
CandidateKey
