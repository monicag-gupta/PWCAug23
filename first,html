        HTML is an acronym which stands for 
        Hyper Text Markup Language which is 
        used for creating web pages and web applications.
         Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup 
         Language, and Web page.

        Hyper Text: HyperText simply means 
        "Text within Text." A text has a link within 
        it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a 
        link which brings you to a new webpage, you 
        have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a
         way to link two or more web pages 
         (HTML documents) with each other.

        Markup language: A markup language is a 
        computer language that is used to apply 
        layout and formatting conventions to a 
        text document. Markup language makes 
        text more interactive and dynamic. It can 
        turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
        </pre>
        <h3><a href="#top">Top of the Page</a></h3>
        <hr>
        <a name="div4">Division 4</a>
        <pre>
        Web Page: A web page is a document which is 
        commonly written in HTML and translated by a 
        web browser. A web page can be identified by 
        entering an URL. A Web page can be of the 
        static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML
         only, we can create static web pages.

        Hence, HTML is a markup language which 
        is used for creating attractive web pages 
        with the help of styling, and which looks 
        in a nice format on a web browser. 
        An HTML document is made of many HTML 
        tags and each HTML tag contains different 
        content.
