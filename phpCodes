The PHP command ‘echo’ or ‘print’ is used to output the parameters passed to it
The typical usage for this is to send data to the client’s web-browser
Syntax
void echo (string arg1 [, string argn...]) 
void print (string arg1 [, string argn...]) 
In practice, arguments are not passed in parentheses since echo is a language construct rather than an actual function

$_COOKIE : Contains information from HTTP cookies.
